    "Description": "Using self-supervised learning, the authors pre-trained a large model using one millon unlabelled molecules from ChEMBL. This model can subsequently be fine-tuned for various QSAR tasks. Here, we provide the encodings for the molecular structures using the pre-trained model, not the fine-tuned QSAR models.\n",
